## 3. Phase 2: Security Selection & Screening

### Financial Purpose
Identify securities exhibiting characteristics that historically precede significant price movements. Focus on liquid stocks with strong momentum and institutional interest.

### Screening Criteria

#### 1. **Liquidity Requirements**
- **Minimum Daily Volume**: 1,000,000 shares
- **Rationale**: Ensures ability to enter/exit positions without significant slippage
- **Impact**: Reduces transaction costs and improves execution quality

#### 2. **Price Range**
- **Minimum Price**: $10.00
- **Maximum Price**: $500.00
- **Rationale**: Avoid penny stocks (high manipulation risk) and ultra-high priced stocks (capital efficiency)

#### 3. **Momentum Indicators**
- **20-day Price Change**: > 5% (bullish momentum)
- **Volume Surge**: Current volume > 1.5x 20-day average
- **Rationale**: Momentum tends to persist; unusual volume indicates institutional activity

#### 4. **Market Sentiment**
- **News Sentiment Score**: Weighted analysis of recent news
- **Social Sentiment**: Optional social media sentiment analysis
- **Rationale**: Positive sentiment can amplify technical moves

### Watchlist Management
- **Core Watchlist**: S&P 500 components + high-volume ETFs
- **Dynamic Additions**: Previous day's unusual volume stocks
- **Exclusions**: Stocks in earnings blackout period (2 days before/after)

### Technical Implementation
- **Service**: `SecurityScannerService` (`security_scanner.py`)
- **Methods**: 
  - `_scan_securities()`: Main scanning logic
  - `_analyze_security()`: Individual stock analysis
  - `_meets_criteria()`: Criteria evaluation
- **Integration**: Calls `NewsService` for sentiment analysis

### Expected Output

- **Data Captured**: Price, volume, momentum metrics, sentiment scores
- **Ranking**: Securities ranked by composite score (momentum + volume + sentiment)

---

## 4. Phase 3: Pattern Analysis & Recognition

### Financial Purpose
Identify repetitive price patterns that historically precede directional moves. Patterns provide entry timing and initial stop-loss levels.

### Pattern Categories

#### 1. **Candlestick Patterns** (1-3 day formations)
Technical patterns formed by price action within individual trading sessions.

- **Bullish Patterns**:
  - **Hammer**: Rejection of lower prices, potential reversal
  - **Bullish Engulfing**: Strong buying overtaking previous selling
  - **Morning Star**: Three-day reversal pattern
  
- **Bearish Patterns**:
  - **Shooting Star**: Rejection of higher prices
  - **Bearish Engulfing**: Strong selling overtaking buying
  - **Evening Star**: Three-day topping pattern

- **Financial Significance**: Entry/exit timing with defined risk levels

#### 2. **Chart Patterns** (5-50 day formations)
Larger structural patterns indicating potential breakouts or breakdowns.

- **Continuation Patterns**:
  - **Bull Flag**: Brief consolidation in uptrend (target: flag pole height)
  - **Ascending Triangle**: Higher lows against resistance
  
- **Reversal Patterns**:
  - **Double Bottom**: Support holding twice (target: pattern height)
  - **Head and Shoulders**: Trend exhaustion pattern

- **Financial Significance**: Position sizing and target price determination

#### 3. **Support/Resistance Levels**
Key price levels where supply/demand imbalances occur.

  - **Volume Spike**: Institutional activity signal
  - **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**: Accumulation/distribution
  - **Volume Divergence**: Warning of trend weakness

### Pattern Scoring System
Each pattern receives a confidence score (0-100) based on:
- **Pattern Clarity**: How well-formed is the pattern (40%)
- **Volume Confirmation**: Does volume support the pattern (30%)
- **Trend Alignment**: Pattern aligns with overall trend (30%)

## 5. Phase 4: Signal Generation & Validation

### Financial Purpose
Convert pattern analysis into actionable trading signals with specific entry, stop-loss, and target prices. Validate signals against multiple technical indicators to ensure high-probability setups.

### Signal Generation Process

#### 1. **Technical Indicator Calculation**
Multiple indicators provide signal confirmation and filtering.

- **Momentum Indicators**:
  - **RSI (14-period)**: Overbought/oversold conditions
    - Buy consideration: RSI < 30 (oversold bounce)
    - Sell consideration: RSI > 70 (overbought)
  
  - **MACD**: Trend strength and direction
    - Buy signal: MACD line crosses above signal line
    - Trend confirmation: Both lines above zero

- **Trend Indicators**:
  - **Moving Averages**: 20-day and 50-day
    - Bullish: Price > 20 MA > 50 MA
    - Support levels for stop-loss placement
  
  - **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility and mean reversion
    - Buy setup: Price touches lower band with RSI oversold
    - Volatility expansion: Bands widening indicates breakout

#### 2. **Signal Scoring Algorithm**
Weighted scoring system combining all factors:

```
Signal Score = (Pattern Score × 0.35) + 
               (Indicator Score × 0.30) + 
               (Trend Score × 0.20) + 
               (Volume Score × 0.15)
```

- **Score > 75**: Strong BUY signal
- **Score 60-75**: Moderate BUY signal  
- **Score 40-60**: HOLD (no action)
- **Score 25-40**: Moderate SELL signal
- **Score < 25**: Strong SELL signal

#### 3. **Risk-Reward Calculation**
Every signal must meet minimum risk-reward requirements.

- **Stop-Loss Calculation**:
  - Pattern-based: Just below pattern support
  - ATR-based: 2 × Average True Range below entry
  - Percentage-based: Maximum 2% below entry

- **Profit Target Calculation**:
  - Pattern projection (e.g., flag pole height)
  - Resistance levels from pattern analysis
  - Minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio

#### 4. **Signal Validation Checklist**
Final validation before signal approval:
- ✓ Pattern confidence > 60%
- ✓ At least 2 confirming indicators
- ✓ Risk-reward ratio ≥ 3:1
- ✓ Stop-loss within 2% risk tolerance
- ✓ No conflicting signals from other timeframes

### Position Sizing Formula
```
Position Size = (Account Value × Risk Per Trade) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)

Where:
- Risk Per Trade = 1% of account (adjustable)
- Maximum Position = 10% of account value
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Service**: `TechnicalAnalysisService` (`technical_analysis.py`)
- **Methods**:
  - `_calculate_indicators_manual()`: Technical indicator calculations
  - `_generate_rule_based_signal()`: Signal scoring algorithm
