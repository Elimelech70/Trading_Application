MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX SCHEDULE CONFIGURATION
================================================

Since your coordination service already has some scheduling functionality
(as evidenced by the working /schedule/status endpoint), here are the
manual steps to add the missing /schedule/config endpoints:

1. Open coordination_service.py in your editor

2. Find the /schedule/status route in the _setup_routes method

3. Add the /schedule/config route right after it (see schedule_config_patch.py)

4. In the __init__ method, add:
   - self._load_schedule_config() after logger initialization

5. Add the helper methods at the class level:
   - _load_schedule_config()
   - _set_default_schedule_config()

6. Save the file and restart the coordination service

The patch code handles:
- GET /schedule/config - Returns current configuration
- POST /schedule/config - Updates and saves configuration
- Persistence via schedule_config.json file
- Integration with existing scheduler_enabled flag

After applying these changes:
1. Stop the coordination service (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again: python coordination_service.py
3. The "Configure Schedule" button should now work!
